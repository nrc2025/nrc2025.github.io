Applications for the 2025 IMS New Researchers Conference are now closed.

Attendees are expected to participate in both the poster session and speed talk presentations. Your presentation title and abstract are required in the application.

### Eligibility
Attendance is invitation only. Submitting an application does not guarantee entry. Space is limited, and applications will be considered on a first-come, first-served basis. The organizing committee will prioritize individuals who are starting or recently started faculty positions, although postdocs and senior graduate students may also be considered. Applicants must have received their PhD between 2018 and 2025.

IMS membership is required to attend. If you are not yet a member, you can learn more and sign up on the [IMS website](https://imstat.org/individual-membership/). 

Selected participants can expect to receive invitations by early June.
