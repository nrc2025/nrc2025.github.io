## General Information

The [Institute of Mathematical Statistics (IMS)](https://imstat.org/) sponsors the New Researchers Conference (NRC) every year, which takes place the week before [Joint Statistical Meetings (JSM)](https://www.amstat.org/meetings/joint-statistical-meetings). NRC promotes networking and interaction among new researchers in the field of statistics, biostatistics, and probability, including those who expect to hold tenure-track positions in the near future. Attendees will present their research through brief expository talks and posters, and have the chance to mingle throughout the day. There will be longer talks by senior researchers, and panels on various topics such as publishing, grant applications, collaboration, and mentoring.
