## General Information

The [Institute of Mathematical Statistics (IMS)](https://imstat.org/) New Researchers Conference (NRC) takes place every year the week before the [Joint Statistical Meetings (JSM)](https://www.amstat.org/meetings/joint-statistical-meetings). NRC promotes networking and interaction among new researchers in the fields of statistics, biostatistics, and probability, including those who expect to hold tenure-track positions in the near future. Attendees have the opportunity to present their research through brief expository talks and posters and meet other early-career researchers. There will be panels and presentations by senior researchers on topics including publishing, grant applications, collaboration, and mentoring. Learn more about previous NRC symposia [here](https://imstat.org/ims-groups/ims-new-researchers-group/past-conferences/).
