Dr. [Yong Zeng](https://z.web.umkc.edu/zengy/) is a Program Director in the Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS) within NSF’s Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences. In this role, he oversees statistical theory and methods, supporting research spanning stochastic modeling, Bayesian inference, financial econometrics, and applications of statistics across scientific disciplines. Prior to joining NSF, Dr. Zeng earned his Ph.D. in Statistics from the University of Wisconsin--Madison and served on the faculty at the University of Missouri--Kansas City, where he led work in stochastic nonlinear filtering, high-performance Bayesian computation, time‑series analysis, and statistical genomics.

In his current role at NSF, Dr.Zeng provides strategic oversight for proposal review, shapes funding priorities in statistical sciences, and fosters collaborations across mathematical, physical, and life sciences. He is also engaged in initiatives promoting the integration of statistics and data science into emerging interdisciplinary research areas, supporting the next generation of statisticians and data scientists through training programs and early‑career awards. Dr.Zeng’s leadership reflects a commitment to advancing both the theoretical foundations and practical applications of statistics in addressing complex scientific and societal challenges.
